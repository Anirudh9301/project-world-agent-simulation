# project-world-agent-simulation
Project World simulates a dynamic society of 50+ agents with unique professions, beliefs, relationships, and governance preferences. Agents work, trade, evolve, and influence governance and belief systems. The model tracks economy, satisfaction, and societal shifts with visual analytics, emergent dynamics, and event-driven change.
# 🌍 Project World – AI-Driven Agent-Based Societal Simulation

**Project World** is an advanced agent-based simulation that models the rise and evolution of a virtual society. Driven by Artificial Intelligence, agents in this ecosystem live, work, believe, govern, trade, build, and evolve. The goal is to simulate realistic, emergent behavior in complex societies through AI-powered interactions.

## 🔥 Highlights

- 🤖 **Autonomous Agents** – Over 1,000 intelligent agents with unique traits like profession, belief, satisfaction, and governance preference.
- 🧑‍🌾 **Diverse Professions** – Agents act as Farmers, Miners, Builders, Traders, Priests, Politicians, and Blacksmiths — all affecting economy and society differently.
- 🧠 **Belief Systems** – Watch as ideologies like Monotheism, Naturalism, and Spiritualism compete and evolve through influence and persuasion.
- 🏛 **Dynamic Governance** – Power shifts between Democracy, Monarchy, Oligarchy, and Anarchy based on political influence and agent satisfaction.
- 💰 **Economic Fluctuations** – Agents earn income, spend resources, experience inflation, and affect trade and wealth distribution.
- 🏗 **Infrastructure Simulation** – Builders construct vital infrastructure, which can be destroyed by natural disasters or societal collapse.
- 📊 **Real-Time Visualization** – See belief trends, economic changes, governance shifts, and agent satisfaction evolve over time via live plots.
- 📋 **Agent Analytics** – Exportable DataFrame of agent stats for deeper data science analysis or machine learning integration.
