# project-world-agent-simulation
Project World simulates a dynamic society of 50+ agents with unique professions, beliefs, relationships, and governance preferences. Agents work, trade, evolve, and influence governance and belief systems. The model tracks economy, satisfaction, and societal shifts with visual analytics, emergent dynamics, and event-driven change.
